hex edits 16 byte blocks instead of lines.
Every sixteen bytes will be displayed as the following
offset     bytes 0-7                                       ASCII representation
0xFFFFFFFF|FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF|........

ARGUMENTS
[file ...]	list of files to be edited

ADDRESSING
'.'	the current offset
n	hexadecimal number between 0 and FFFFFFFF
$	the last available offset in the buffer
+n,-n	the symbol '+' or '-', followed by a positive hexadecimal number specifying a positive or negative
	change to the current offset relative to the current offset.

COMMANDS
a [address]
hexadecimal values
.
	Reads hexadeimal values from the input and places them after the line specified by '.' (current line), or 'n' (hexadecimal offset).

i [address]
hexadecimal values
.
	Reads hexadecimal values from the input and places them before the offset specified by '.' (current offset), or 'n' (hexadecimal offset).

c [address]
hexadecimal values
.
	Reads hexadecimal values from the input and places them at the specified offset.

d [address],[address]
	deletes the specified

m [address],[address],[address]
	Moves a series of words located at the starting offset until the range to begin after the target offset

n
	the next file from the command line argument list is edited.

r
	rewinds the argument list and the first tile in the list is edited

v [address],[address]
	prints the words located between the first offset and the second

w [file]
	writes the specified file buffer to the pathname. if no file is specified, the current edited file will be written

q
	causes hex to terminate

q!	
	causes hex to terminate ignoring any edited files

wq
	writes the buffer then terminates.

wq!
	writes the buffer then terminates, ignoring unwritten files.

y [address],[address] [buffer]
	places the specified offset range in a named buffer for later retrieval via 'p'

p [address] [buffer]
	places the specified buffer at the specified offset

s [variable name] [value]
	s is used to set environment variables. there is currently only one environment variable called WORDSIZE which holds an integer that determines the size of a word.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
WORDSIZE	contains an integer value representing the size of a word in bytes. WORDSIZE is used to determine offset positions.

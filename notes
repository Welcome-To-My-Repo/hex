what can hex do?

append bytes to a file from a given offset between 1 to the end of the file.
insert bytes in a file at a given offset between 0 to preceding the last offset of the file.
delete a number of bytes starting at a given offset.
replace a number of bytes starting at a given offset.

how does the hex interface work.

a command is typed, then the enter key is pressed.
an empty command prints sixteen bytes beginning at the current offset.

'w' increases the current offset by a single byte.
'W' increases the current offset by sixteen bytes.
0x-------- positions the current offset at the offset specified by the hexadecimal number
